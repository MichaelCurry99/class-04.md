# Links, Functions, and Layouts

If you ever used a searching browse, you should realize that using them provides millions of links to the World internet. With links, we can access information in which a library may not be capable of having, since he can have a limited capacity. The way these links work is by the use of the elements "a" and "li". These two hold up the link in order to take you to the website. With learning of how layouts work, I've used CSS to help make certaain paragraphs and images align to a certain position in design. This part of CSS is utterly important to have because this is how you'd like to display your website.

Looking through how functions work, they operate similar to the "while" and "if/else" elements in Javascript coding. The use of functions are relevant enough for many of the commands needed to operate a website. They are used to organize the effect used in JavaScript, usually to display a message, create a button, and many more wonderful things. Although in the beginning of learning to use coding is difficult, it can get better with an extra hand, so much that it can lower the time consumption you need to finish a website. So always remember, the coder will always need a partner!
